abstract: |-
  A guy named Lars walks into IKEA to buy a bedside table.
  Simple mission. He’s a simple man.

  He finds the table, grabs the flat-pack box, and walks toward the exit.
  But as he passes the “As-Is” bargain section, an IKEA employee jumps out from behind a shelf like a Swedish ninja.

  Employee:
  “Sir! You forgot step one.”

  Lars:
  “…What’s step one?”

  Employee:
  “You must first get hopelessly lost in the showroom for 45 minutes.”

  Before he can react, the employee spins him around and shoves him into the maze of staged bedrooms. Lars is now trapped between a fake teenage boy’s room and a couple arguing over a lamp called BLÅSTJÄRN.

  Eventually he finds his way back to the exit — sweating, dehydrated, spiritually changed. He buys the table and goes home.
